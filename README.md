# PyScripts

These are simple programs / scripts that I've written in Python. These all have basic utilities, and I might combine them to be one program eventually.

## Programs
- qirky (Quick Information Retrieval Kit for You)         : A shitty neofetch alternative
- favPy (Favorites Organizer in Python)                   : Organize your favorite ganes by genre
- speedPy (Speed test in Python)                          : Check your upload and download speed via terminal
- woody (Write, Organize, and Observe Daily Yields)       : Organize logs by categories, and observe patterns over time.
